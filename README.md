A collection of libraries, a pipeline plugin, and a CDAP service for performing data
cleansing, transformation, and filtering using a set of data manipulation instructions
(directives). These instructions are either generated using an interative visual tool or
are manually created.

  * Data Prep defines few concepts that might be useful if you are just getting started with it. Learn about them [here](wrangler-docs/concepts.md)
  * The Data Prep Transform is [separately documented](wrangler-transform/wrangler-docs/data-prep-transform.md).
  * [Data Prep Cheatsheet](wrangler-docs/cheatsheet.md)
  * [Byte Size and Time Duration Parsers](wrangler-docs/byte-size-time-duration-parsers.md) - New parsers for working with byte sizes and time durations

## New Features

More [here](wrangler-docs/upcoming-features.md) on upcoming features.

  * **User Defined Directives, also known as UDD**, allow you to create custom functions to transform records within CDAP DataPrep or a.k.a Wrangler. CDAP comes with a comprehensive library of functions. There are however some omissions, and some specific cases for which UDDs are the solution. Additional information on how you can build your custom directives [here](wrangler-docs/custom-directive.md).
    * Migrating directives from version 1.0 to version 2.0 [here](wrangler-docs/directive-migration.md)
    * Information about Grammar [here](wrangler-docs/grammar/grammar-info.md)
    * Various `TokenType` supported by system [here](../api/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/TokenType.java)
    * Custom Directive Implementation Internals [here](wrangler-docs/udd-internal.md)

  * A new capability that allows CDAP Administrators to **restrict the directives** that are accessible to their users.
More information on configuring can be found [here](wrangler-docs/exclusion-and-aliasing.md)
